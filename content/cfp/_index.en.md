<p>Fri3d Camp is <strong>created by the people who attend</strong>. Everyone lends a helping hand to create an excellent experience for all participants.</p>

<p>All <strong>workshops, talks and other activities</strong> during Fri3d Camp are run by participants, that means you! We try to <strong>corall all your ideas into an official program</strong> with our <a href="https://pretalx.fri3d.be/fri3dcamp2026/cfp">Call for Proposal</a>. Submit your proposal(s), and if it gets accepted, we will <strong>support you where necessary</strong>.</p>
<p>In the 2026 edition we'd like to focus more on <strong>participant's projects</strong>, even if they are not the subject of a talk or workshop. Do you want to bring a project you'd like to share with others at the camp? Please consider submitting it as a proposal!</p>

<div class="block--centered">
<p>All <strong>science- and technology-themed</strong> activities are welcomed. Especially projects you are working on, skills you want to teach others and passions you'd like to share. There's room for activities of <strong>all experience and skill levels</strong>. You can use another language than Dutch for your activity, but please mention this in your proposal(s).</p>

<p>Your proposal <strong>doesn't have to be a traditional workshop or talk</strong>, we welcome every idea! You could also build a system of pneumatic tubes, organise a high-tech treasure hunt, build a huge geodesic dome ... We're open to all kinds of ideas, and we'd love to see how we can help you make them a reality!</p>
