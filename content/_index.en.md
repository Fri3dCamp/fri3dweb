<h2>What to expect?</h2>
<p>Fri3d Camp is an interesting mix of technology festival, easy-going camping atmosphere, and a hacker convention.</p>
</p>All of our talks and workshops are brought by visitors such like yourself. Have a look at <a href="https://content.fri3d.be/confirmedcontent">the 2024 program</a>!</p>
<p>We take our inspiration from the large European hacker camps like <a href="https://events.ccc.de/camp/">CCC</a>, <a href="https://www.emfcamp.org/">EMF</a> and <a href="https://why2025.org/">WHY</a>.</p>

<p>At Fri3d Camp the <strong>line between participants and organization is much blurrier</strong> than on many other events. For example, we expect everybody to help out by doing a shift at the bar, the infodesk, helping with workshops, ... You'll find that <strong>everybody is helpful</strong> and would love to help you out. The motto is <a href="deelnemen/excellent">Be Excellent To Each Other</a>.</p>

<p>Fri3d Camp has a clear focus on families. That means that roughly <strong>one third of our participants are kids</strong>. They are full-fledged participants for us, and we like to offer them challenging activities involving science and technology.</p>
<p>It's the <a href="/deelnemen">participants themselves who bring all the activities</a>. In the past we've been casting aluminum, launched a weather balloon (and rockets), played a high-tech forest game, ... Fri3d Camp is a <strong>playground</strong> for everyone who likes science and technology.</p>

<p>We <strong>camp in the forest</strong>. It's not a congress centre, but a terrain which normally hosts youth clubs. This brings a <strong>relaxed summer atmosphere</strong> which also has lots of room for creativity, laptops, and all kinds of (low and high) tech.</p>

<p>We encourage every participant to <strong>bring their own projects</strong> and tell everyone about them. Ad-hoc workshops, talks and activities are continously being organized during the camp.</p>
