	<p>Fri3d Camp is a two-yearly family-friendy summer camp for hackers, makers and DIYers. In 2024 we'll be having our fifth edition.</p>
	<p>Following the hacker ethos, we have but one rule:<br>
		<strong>Be excellent to each other</strong>. Every participant has one sole task; to make the camp a fantastic experience for everybody.</p>
	<p>Our inspiration are the large European camps which are organized every two years, such as <a href="https://events.ccc.de/camp/">CCC Camp</a> or <a href="https://mch2022.org">MCH</a>.</p>
	<h2>Orga-team</h2>
	<p>The first three editions of Fri3d Camp were built by a loose team of volunteers, backed by IO Lab bvba.</p>
	<p>After three editions of Fri3d Camp, Fri3d vzw was founded as a non-profit to govern the interests of the organization.</p>
